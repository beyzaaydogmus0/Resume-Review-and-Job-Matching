Resume Review and Job Matching
This project presents a machine learning-based job and CV
 matching system designed to improve the efficiency of recruitment pro
cesses. By employing natural language processing (NLP) and machine
 learning algorithms, including Random Forest, LightGBM, and Logis
tic Regression, the system automates the evaluation of resumes and job
 postings. Two primary datasets—one for resumes and the other for job
 descriptions—were generated through web scraping and synthetic data
 creation. The data underwent preprocessing steps such as text normal
ization, feature extraction, and data labeling to ensure consistency and
 accuracy.
 Advanced feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BOW),
 and Word2Vec were utilized to analyze the relevance between resumes
 and job descriptions. Model performance was evaluated using precision,
 recall, and F1-score metrics. The results showed that LSTM outper
formed both LightGBM and Logistic Regression, achieving the high
est Accuracy: 0.9526, Precision: 0.9753, Recall: 0.9275, F1-Score: 0.9508.
 This indicates that ensemble methods and gradient-boosting techniques
 are particularly effective for job matching tasks.
 Thefindings demonstrate the potential of machine learning models to sig
nificantly enhance recruitment workflows, providing more accurate and
 efficient job matching for both employers and job seekers.
